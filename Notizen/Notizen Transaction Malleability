Transaction Malleabilty:

Alice sends 1 bitcoin to Bob with a Tx id A. However, before the transaction is confirmed,
Bob alters the signature data of the transaction to produce a new Tx id B. Having received the 1 bitcoin but with Tx id B,
Bob then informs Alice that he has not received the bitcoin. When Alice searches a block explorer using Tx id A to confirm Bobâ€™s claim,
she cannot find the transaction. Assuming a failed transaction and that the 1 bitcoin was never sent, Alice sends Bob another bitcoin,
resulting in a total of 2 bitcoins being sent to Bob.
