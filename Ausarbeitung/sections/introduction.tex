Bitcoin is an online currency which allows decentralized transactions between peers of the Bitcoin network. It is a network which is thought through and discussed very well in the first whitepaper released on Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto. \cite{nakamoto} But even then it is of course not perfect and needed changes to be made over the years. One of these was Segregated Witness, otherwise known as SegWit. \\
Segregated Witness mainly addresses the problems of transaction limitation and transaction malleability and is one of the biggest, if not the biggest \cite{bitoinmagazine}, protocol upgrade to date. \\
In this paper there will be explained why it was needed, how it was implemented and adopted, and finally if and how the effects helped Bitcoin become better.
